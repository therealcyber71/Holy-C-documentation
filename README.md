## Hello world

In Holy C there is no "printf" or "cout" statement, adding strings in double quotes itself acts as an output statement.

For example
```HolyC
C:/Home>"Hello World";
```
Output:
```HolyC
Hello World0.000117s // where 0.000117s is the execution time
```

The code can be written in the terminal itself, it's almost similar to using the Python terminal as the command prompt or the powershell on Windows, due to this awesome
feature, HolyC can be used as a Porgramming language as well to write terminal commands.

It is also worth noting that statements after `//` are not read by the compiler, hence they are used as comments.
